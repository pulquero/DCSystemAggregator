# About

A DC system DBus service that aggregates multiple DC loads and sources.
If you have DC load/source DBus services but no DC system, then you need this for the UI/VRM DC system/power component to function correctly.


# Install

Install [SetupHelper](https://github.com/kwindrem/SetupHelper), use [this version](https://github.com/pulquero/SetupHelper) if you want this package
to be available by default, else manually add it.

Turn on `Has DC system` under `System setup`.
